# TossGame

A game where players bet on a coin toss. Playersâ€™ bet is always one-tenth of smart contract available funds. Players can withdraw at any time during the game. The owner can fund the smart contract and withdraw the money. If a player wins, the player receives twice the bet amount and when a player loses, the owner of the contract gets the bet amount.
